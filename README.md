# Indian-Meals
The JavaScript capstone project is about building a web application based on an external API. We selected an API that provides data about Indian meals and then built the webapp around it. The webapp has 2 user interfaces, the homepage and a popup window with more data about a meal that which also allows you to comment on it.
