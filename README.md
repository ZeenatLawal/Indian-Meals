# Indian-Meals
> The JavaScript capstone project is about building a web application based on an external API. We selected an API that provides data about Indian meals and then built the web app around it. The web app has 2 user interfaces, the homepage and a popup window with more data about a meal that which also allows you to comment on it.

> Two APIs were used for the web app: The [Meals DB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and the [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) from Microverse. The meals API was used to retrieve and display details for Indian meals and the involvement API was used to record and display likes and comments for each meal.
